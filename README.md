# stock-profit

##Let's say you have an array for which element i is the price of a given stock on day i.
If you were allowed to complete at most one transaction (i.e. buy one and sell one stock), create an algorithm to find the maximum profit.
Note that you cannot sell a stock before buying it.
Example:

Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
